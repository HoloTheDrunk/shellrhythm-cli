# Custom layouts

## The ingame way

To do that, go to Settings and press L. Then, press enter and type your entire layout. You can use the arrow keys to move around the displayed grid of keys. Once it's done, press Escape to save it.

## The custom file way

Making a custom layout this way is fairly easy, all you need to do is create a file named whatever layout you want (with no extension!) and just type in the letters you want to use for your layout!

Here's a simple example with the AZERTY keyboard layout:
```
azertyuiop
qsdfghjklm
wxcvbn,;:!
```

3 rows, 10 characters per row. That's it.
