# Custom layouts

Making a custom layout is fairly easy, all you need to do is create a file named whatever layout you want (with no extension!) and just type in the letters you want to use for your layout!

Here's a simple example with the AZERTY keyboard layout:
```
azertyuiop
qsdfghjklm
wxcvbn,;:!
```

3 rows, 10 characters per row. That's it.
