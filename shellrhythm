#Hi! If you're curious, this is a bash file. It's made to be run on bash, the "shell" (the thing that turns command lines into machine instructions) of Linux.
#If you're on Windows, try running "run.bat" instead.
#So yeah, I'm sorry, --import is a linux exclusive... though you can run "python ./src/import.py <url>" as an alternative.
